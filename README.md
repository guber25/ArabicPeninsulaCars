# ArabicPeninsulaCars
This is the repo for the statistical learning individual project. The aim is to understand which are the variables that most influence the price of cars in so similar yet different countries, like the ones in the Arabic peninsula.

The analysis consists by supervised and unsupervised statistical learning models, in particular I used regression trees and random forest, with a very nice code, if I have to be honest. I haven't still decided which model to do for unsupervised, probably the PCA but I'll see and I will keep you updated :D

Feel free to look at the code and give me feedback of any type. I will provide also an R version of the file and an html markdown R file so that you can see all the analysis even if you do not have R installed.

The data is taken from the Kaggle dataset "Cars in the middle east": https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bushnag/cars-in-the-middle-east.

Enjoy!
